                    The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini is a powerful novel set in Afghanistan and the United States, 
                    spanning from the 1970s to the early 2000s. The story follows Amir, a young boy from a wealthy family 
                    in Kabul, and his close friendship with Hassan, the son of his father's servant. 
                    The two boys share a deep bond, but their friendship is strained when Amir fails to intervene
                    during a traumatic event where Hassan is assaulted. This incident haunts Amir into adulthood,
                    leading to feelings of guilt and regret.<br><br>
                    Years later, Amir and his father flee to the United States
                    during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, where Amir builds a new life. However,
                    a call from an old family friend brings Amir back to his homeland, now under Taliban rule, 
                    to face his past and seek redemption. The novel explores themes of friendship, betrayal, guilt, and 
                    the complex nature of redemption, offering a poignant look at the human capacity for both good and evil.

                    "For you, a thousand times over." <br><br><br>
                    "I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, <br>but with pain gathering its things, 
                    packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night."
